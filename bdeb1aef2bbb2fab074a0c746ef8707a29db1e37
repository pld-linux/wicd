- up to 1.7.0
- package netherland's manuals
- split GTK client from main to client subpackage
- CLI client added
- client subpackages descriptionss/summaries totally (were totally inconsistent)
- commented _libexecdir redefinition (but setup reworked, so it can be
  uncommented and spec builds/works). not sure about that anyway
- package installation doesnt work because of fr_FR, etc. but instalation
  scripts has been fucked by wicd devs (so its not mine fault and dont have
  time now to fix it)
